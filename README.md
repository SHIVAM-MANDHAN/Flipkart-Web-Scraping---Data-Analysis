# Flipkart-Web-Scraping-and-Data-Analysis

This repository contains a web scraping project using the Python library Beautiful Soup. In this project, I extracted data such as brand name, price, fit, and rating from the men's shirt section of Flipkart's website. The goal was to create a comprehensive database for analysis and uncover interesting insights.

## Repository Files

This repository contains the following files:

- `Webscraping Flipkart Data.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook provides the step-by-step implementation of web scraping using Beautiful Soup. It outlines the process of extracting data from the Flipkart website.

- `Extracted Flipkart Data.csv`: This CSV file contains the extracted data in a structured format. It serves as the database with 1477 rows and multiple columns, capturing essential information about the men's shirts.

- `Analyzing Flipkart Data.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook showcases the data analysis phase. It includes data cleaning techniques, exploratory data analysis, and the identification of interesting insights.

By leveraging the power of Beautiful Soup and pandas, I was able to extract, store, and analyze a substantial amount of data. Feel free to explore the code, data, and analysis files to gain inspiration for your own projects or enhance your understanding of web scraping and data analysis techniques.
